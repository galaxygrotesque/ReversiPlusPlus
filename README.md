# ReversiPlusPlus
Reversi—but better. An Archive of Our Own “dark mode” reskin with a focus on readability and less noise.

**This project is a work-in-progress.** Please bear with me while I find my stylesheet legs.

### Fonts
**Good news:** ReversiPlusPlus uses some common web-safe font alternatives in addition to Ao3’s default fonts!

**Bad news:** Due to how Ao3 handles user skins and limits CSS, they can’t be automatically packaged with the skin. (I went through a grieving process here. Trust me, I really wish they could.)

This means **if you want alternative fonts** to appear, you’ll have to **install them on your device**—PC, phone, tablet, or whatever else.

For your convenience, here is a handy table containing (most) of the fonts and where to find them.

## Installation
ReversiPlusPlus builds right off of Ao3’s existing stylesheet, so no extra add-ons or browser extensions are required!

Installing is as simple as creating a new site skin for your user. All user site skins are private by default—no worries about accidentally making something public.

To create a new site skin:

1. Navigate to [ArchiveOfOurOwn](https://archiveofourown.org/).

2. While logged in, go to your dashboard.

3. On the dashboard, select “**Skins**”.

	![Step3Image](img/install-steps-02.png)

4. The Skins page will have multiple buttons. In the top right-hand corner, select ”**Create Site Skin**”.

	![Step4Image](img/install-steps-03.png)

	Welcome to the Create New Site Skin page!
	
	![Step5Image01](img/install-steps-04.png)

5. Fill in the following fields:

	1. The **Type** field must be set to “**Site Skin**”.
	2. The **Title** field must have a value in it, and that value must be unique because Ao3 only distinguishes user site skins by name, not by user.
	3. The **CSS** field must have CSS in it—i.e., the text in [```ReversiPlusPlus.css```](https://github.com/galaxygrotesque/ReversiPlusPlus/blob/main/css/ReversiPlusPlus.css). Copy-paste baybeeee ✨

	**Don’t submit just yet!**
	
	Need a couple extra things first—namely, the options hidden under this fun little “**Show ↓**” button guy under the giant CSS field:
	
	![Step5Image02](img/install-steps-05.png)
	
	You’ll get a section that looks like this:
	
	![Step5Image03](img/install-steps-06.png)
	
	Here, fill in the following fields:
	
	4. The **What it does:** field must be set to “**add on to archive skin**”.
	5. In the **Media** section, the “⬜ **all**” option must be checked.

	All done?

6. Slap **Submit**!

	![Step6Image](img/install-steps-07.png)

7. You’ll be taken to a new page with your site skin with a “**Skin was successfully created**” message. Scroll aaaaall the way down to the bottom where you’ll see these four options:

	![Step7Image](img/install-steps-08.png)
	
	Hit **Use**.

And voilà! Skin installed.

## Mobile
In the works! There will be a separate CSS file for a mobile skin soon.
